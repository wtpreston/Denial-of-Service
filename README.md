# <h1> Denial of Service </h1>![ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT-error-in-chrome](https://github.com/wtpreston/Denial-of-Service/assets/168564307/369a9dd4-d709-419a-a8e4-e8258c803f90)

My goal with this docuument is to explain the basic idea of Denial of Service attacks. DoS attacks often get a lot of attention online due to the disruption they can cause everyday users, and targets of these attacks are often popular platforms. However, I believe most explanations of DoS attacks are longwinded and complex. I will attempt to break down DoS attacks (specifically DDoS and amplified DDoS) in a way that a layman could understand. <br><br>


Let's start with a basic definition of Denial of Service attacks and then build from there. The simplest definition of a DoS attack is written right in the name. It constitutes any attack through any means that aims to deny service to users. The most famous examples are often complicated attacks involving botnets and thousands of computers, but the simplest DoS attack would genuinely be just.. unplugging the server. Or pouring water onto a computer hosting a website! These seem like crude methods but they definitely get the job done. However we don't often hear about attacks like these in the news as they usually require physical access to the building, and attackers often would like to remain as faaaar away as they can from their targets. So how do they actually do it?


<h2>How They Actually Do It</h2>
![pexels-arturoaez220-8942180](https://github.com/wtpreston/Denial-of-Service/assets/168564307/bfa2e90d-b268-497c-bf68-36c028ca9e91)

As with all good explanations I'll digress into some heavy metaphor. Most communication on the internet resembles a human conversation, even if it's between two machines. A typical example might look like the client will sending a series of requests to a server, and the server responding with whatever information the client requested. This is a lot like how as a customer you'll enter a restaurant, make a series of requests for different food, and leave after being served successfully.  <br><br>
But what if I'm a malicious customer out on the internet, and I don't actually *want* to be served successfully? Instead, my goal is to deny service to all other customers! The easiest way to do that would probably be to refuse to give up my table, my connection to the restaurant. I might make endless requests to my waiter and keep them busy at my table so they can't focus on anyone else. Eventually they might get fed up and deny me service altogether, but it's relatively easy to mask my identity (at least on the internet) and walk right back into the restaurant to hold another table hostage for a while! In the end though, I'm only one person, and the restaurant I'm attacking might have hundreds or thousands of open tables and waiters to staff them. <i>How can I possibly affect the service around here all by myself?</i><br><br>


<h2>Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS)</h2>![image_2024-05-27_122527481](https://github.com/wtpreston/Denial-of-Service/assets/168564307/171600e5-d91d-4cf6-8dca-153b3e1af990)

Make your Denial of Service attack exponentially stronger with this one easy trick! The idea behind it is simple: why attack the restaurant alone, when I can have help from thousands of computers around the world? If I walk into the restaurant with one thousand of my henchmen I could very feasibly reserve all the tables and waiters until no one could eat but myself! By one method or another (usually spreading malicious programs online) these attackers gain control of innocent computers all over the world. Their software sits idly in the background waiting for a signal from the master computer. When the attacker wants to deny service at a restaurant, they send out an alert to all infected computers. "Get in line for Restaurant A!". The website suddenly receives thousands of requests from the enslaved machines, increasing the load on the server until it fails. This is like the restaurant shutting down for the day because their waiters are too worn out. These attacks can be so effective that the groups of infected computers are often for rent online. Thankfully we're getting better every day at detecting and mitigating against these bad actors and their traffic. It isn't as effective as it used to be to simply pile on the bandwidth until a server buckles. So how are the attackers evolving in the modern day?


<h2>What is Denial of Service amplification?</h2>
Nowadays it's much more common to see something called an amplified DoS attack. The idea behind it is again very simple: how can we make our attack more effective on a limited budget? If we can't afford to hire any more goons, how can we make the ones we have more powerful?  <br><br>

This time let's represent the server online as a post office, which has a lot of similarities. The post office receives regular traffic through letters in its drop box, sorts the mail and forwards it to its destination. Our goal is to flood that dropbox with so much irregular letters that the post office is either slowed down or closed entirely for the day. However, as I stated we need to do this on a limited budget since we can't just keep hiring goons forever. I myself could turn out a few dozen letters a day, but nowhere near enough to fill up the mailbox. But I'm a crafty attacker and I notice that across the street is a large office building. They have plenty of workers or servers inside that could send a thousand times more traffic than I ever could. How can I get them to do what I want?<br><br>

Here's what we can do with a single letter sent to the office building. "Dear Office Servers, will you tell me what time it is? Your neighbor, the post office." As you can see I've spoofed the sender at the end to make it seem like the request is coming from the post office, so the office's response will be sent to them. The corporate office servers will consider it a simple innocent request and might be happy to tell me the current time according to them. Now on its own this doesn't help me. I've sent one letter, and the post office has received one letter, I've just changed who it is coming from. So right at the end of the letter I'll add the kicker: <br><br>"P.S. <b>Please respond one thousand times"</b>. <br><br> Again the office servers all think to themselves "Oh what an innocent request, I think we can oblige that." and immediately begin flooding the post office with millions of letters all containing the time.<br><br>

I still sent one letter, but the number of letters received by the post office was <i>amplified</i> by a few thousand times thanks to the corporate office's willingness to tell me the time. This sounds far fetched but these bogus time requests really were an avenue for amplification for a short time. Once again nowadays we're getting smarter and smarter with not letting attackers bounce their attacks off of us, but these Denial of Service attacks still occur today.
